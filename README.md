Welcome to the Foundry VTT Adaptation for the [Dragon Ball Universe](https://dbu-rpg.com/) system!

# Thanks
I want to thank multiple people for this, to the multiple people in that one discord thread who have watched my progress and directly motivated me with their own hype, to Heilmern for many, many help on the code, algorithm and logic itself, to CussaMitre on the League of FVTT developer Server for their big help on many questions I've asked, to even some of my irl friends for supporting (and tolerating!) me as I worked on this adaptation.

This serves as my big thank you towards the DBU Community, and as such, without any more words... Thank you. And most importantly, have fun!
